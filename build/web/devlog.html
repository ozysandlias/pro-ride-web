    <h1>11/7/24 Running On Mobile, and improved (but a little buggy) physics</h1>
    <p>
        Just added touch buttons and mobile compressed textures. Looks like the game is running fine in the mobile browser except for some reason there's a persistant afterimage of the first frame. Seems to affecting Safari on desktop as well so I believe it's an issue with that browser. 
        Currently looking into it.

        Also added a little bit of slide so you drift around corners and changed gliding so that it's no longer infinite. Now it's proportional to speed/angle of attack

        Welcome to my web page. I'm working on an untitled skateboarding roguelike inspired by THPS and Kirby Air Ride. This page looks like trash for now, but I'll be making improvements. You can try a very very early demo of the game by navigating to the game page
